# AI Automation Lab Agent Stack

A self-hosted AI phone agent with an AI runtime starting around **₹1 per minute**.
Telephony is external and must be priced separately for the selected carrier and country.

Bare Ubuntu box to a ringing phone in six scripted steps. No SaaS in the middle,
every key stays on your own server.

```
git clone 
cd rapidx-voice-agent-stack
cp .env.example .env      # fill in 8 values
bash deploy/01-deploy-dograh.sh
```

Handing this to an AI coding agent instead? Paste
[`ONE-SHOT-PROMPT.md`](ONE-SHOT-PROMPT.md) and it runs the whole thing end to end.

## The stack

| Layer | Component | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator | [Dograh](https://github.com/dograh-hq/dograh), open source | Node-graph agents, VAD, turn detection, recordings, run logs |
| Telephony | Vobiz | Native Dograh provider, Plivo-compatible, Indian numbers |
| Speech to text | Deepgram `nova-3-general` | Multilingual, holds up to Hinglish on an 8k phone stream |
| Brain | Groq `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` | Fast enough that the pause before a reply is not noticeable |
| Voice | Rumik silk `mulberry` | Roughly 20x cheaper than ElevenLabs at promo rates |
| Console | AI Automation Lab Studio | Starter console; the master prompt rebuilds it as a premium cream React product |

Every layer is swappable. Dograh natively supports Twilio, Telnyx, Plivo, Vonage
and Cloudonix for telephony, and the model pipeline takes any STT, LLM or TTS
provider in its registry.

## What you get

- **A real phone agent.** Answers inbound, places outbound, speaks first, and can
  be interrupted mid-sentence like a person.
- **Ria, a working receptionist persona.** The full prompt stack is in
  [`prompts/ria-system-prompts.md`](prompts/ria-system-prompts.md), and the
  machine-readable workflow is in `workflows/`. Swap two blocks and it is your
  business instead.
- **A management console.** Build agents, generate speech, talk to an agent in the
  browser, see usage and cost in INR.
- **Run records.** Every call logs its transcript, recording, disposition and the
  exact provider pipeline it ran on.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 24.04 VPS, 4GB RAM recommended (2GB works, the deploy script adds swap)
- A Vobiz account with a number, from [console.vobiz.ai](https://console.vobiz.ai)
- API keys: [Deepgram](https://console.deepgram.com),
  [Groq](https://console.groq.com), [Rumik](https://rumik.ai)
- Ports 22, 80, 443 open. Plus 3478, 5349 and UDP 49152-49200 for browser calls.

HTTPS comes free via sslip.io, so no DNS setup is needed. Browser microphone
access requires HTTPS, which is why the deploy issues a real certificate.

## Four failures worth knowing before you start

Each of these cost real debugging time. All four are handled by the scripts, and
documented in full in [`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

1. **A call that connects then sits silent.** The number was bound to a stale
   Vobiz application pointing at a dead answer_url. Let Dograh create its own
   application, and place calls through Dograh, never the raw Vobiz endpoint.

2. **An agent that greets and then ignores you.** Realtime native-audio models do
   not do turn detection over an 8k telephony stream. Use a pipeline, not a
   realtime brain.

3. **An agent that cannot be interrupted.** `allow_interrupt` defaults to false on
   a fresh workflow draft. It is a per-node setting, and no pipeline tuning fixes it.

4. **A broken API container after adding Rumik.** Installing `pipecat-rumik`
   without `--no-deps` pulls upstream pipecat over Dograh's vendored fork.

## Cost

| AI brain | Estimated AI runtime / call minute |
|---|---:|
| Groq Llama 3.3 70B | ₹0.85–₹1.25 |
| Gemini 3.5 Flash-Lite | ₹0.90–₹1.55 |

These estimates cover Deepgram + the selected brain + Rumik promotional economics.
VoBiz, SIP, PSTN, phone numbers, carrier minutes, server, tax and setup are external
and excluded. Verify current provider rates before publishing or quoting.

---

## Security

- Every provider key lives in `.env` or server-side config. Keys never reach the
  browser, the server is the only thing that talks to a provider.
- `.env` is gitignored. Nothing in this repo contains a real credential.
- Outbound calls are billable and guarded behind an explicit confirm.
- Rotate any key that has ever been pasted into a chat, a screenshot or a log.
